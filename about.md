# About Me

![](images/foto-275x300.jpg)

Date of birth: December 18, 1949.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
I spent my young years in Zurich, then moved to the hilly countryside of Eastern Switzerland, where I have been living since 1980.

A florist by training, I continued my education as an activation therapist. I am the mother of three adult children and a passionate gardener and cook.

My love of quilting was sparked in 2000 by the unconventional colors and designs that my friend Berti Feissli used in her quilts (at that time, she was 80).
I realized that pieced quilt making was not just about traditional patchwork patterns, but that I could design quilts in any way I wanted to. Ever since, I have worked with self-dyed cloth, textile printing techniques, and so on.

I was greatly influenced by working with Nancy Crow, Ohio (USA). To date, I have attended a total of five of Nancy’s workshops that she held in Falera (CH).

I systematically learn related techniques that I can use in making my own quilts, for example textile and screen printing (Cécile Trentini), shibori
(Heidi Hunninghaus), cloth dyeing (Heide Stoll-Weber), various stitching techniques (Judith Mundwiler), or embroidery and quilting
(Elsbeth Nusser-Lampe).
